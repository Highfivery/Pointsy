### Minor Changes

- 08b0f23: Add parent authentication and multi-tenant family onboarding: email + password
  sign-up with guardian consent, sign-in, sign-out, signed session cookies, edge
  middleware route protection, and a minimal protected dashboard showing the
  family name and join code. Introduces a driver-agnostic database client
  (neon-serverless in production, node-postgres in CI) and a tenant-isolated
  service layer covered by PGlite integration tests and a DB-backed Playwright
  flow.
